/***********************************************************************************************
 * This code periodically samples the analog voltage from pin A0 at a fixed interval (50 ms),
 * applies an exponential smoothing filter (also known as an exponential moving average) to
 * the raw data, and prints out a timestamp along with the filtered voltage to the Serial Monitor.
 *
 * How it works:
 * 1. 'millis()' is used to track elapsed time, ensuring consistent sampling every 50 ms.
 * 2. Each new reading from 'analogRead(A0)' is combined with the previous smoothed value using:
 *         smoothedValue = alpha * last_val + (1 - alpha) * currentReading
 *    This formula helps reduce high-frequency noise in the signal.
 * 3. The result is converted to a voltage by multiplying with (5.0 / 1024.0) since Arduino ADC
 *    resolution is 10-bit (0â€“1023) over a 5V reference.
 * 4. 'last_val' stores the most recent smoothed value for the next loop iteration.
 * 5. The final filtered voltage and timestamp are sent via Serial.print() for real-time monitoring.
 *
 * This approach helps stabilize sensor readings by smoothing out random fluctuations, which is
 * particularly useful in scenarios involving noisy input signals. The combination of timed
 * sampling and exponential smoothing provides both consistency and responsiveness.
